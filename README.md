# plutus

# Refactoring idea
- What if I made it a website and gave it access to a users Google Drive. The Google Drive could work as a data store/backup and the website could act as the interface.  I think Draw.io do something similar

# Ideas
- Hook into Money Savings Expert somehow to tell people when they could save money on electricity?  Could implement flags for certain categories like utilities etc
Plutus(named after the Greek god of wealth) is a budget app built in Flutter.

# Approach
**I think it's still the right approach to go with the Flutter Desktop app (at least for V1).  Mainly because of cost.**

## Desktop app 
### Benefits:
- Cheaper
- Data security isn't as much of an issue (it's on the users pcs)

### Drawbacks:
- Harder to update (but still possible)
- Harder to build - debatable if I use Electron instead of Flutter

## Web app 
### Benefits:
- Easier to build
- Easier to update
- Easier to get users to try it out

### Drawbacks:
- A lot more expensive
- More competition with other vendors (will take more features to compete)
